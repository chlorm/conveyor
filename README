### Dependencies:

- findutils (will be removed)

- gnused
- guessit
- jq
- rclone

### Rewrite

I have been working on a rewrite in golang now that I have mostly figured out
how this should all work.  The golang variant with exception to guessit does
not depend on any non-golang dependencies.  Since guessit is only used in the
offload-complete script which can be run remotely, this should be a non-issue.
