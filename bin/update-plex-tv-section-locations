# Because the Plex Series Scanner does not handle nested directories, they must
# all be added as separate locations to a section.  However when adding a
# location to a section via the API you must also add all the current
# directories the the request.  This overwrite the locations of a section each
# time it is run.

# WARNING: Most proxies have a default max request size that is to low for this
#          to work.  It is recommened to run this from the same machine running
#          plex to circumvent the proxy and not alter proxy settings.
